# First-ML-Project
This ML project predicts solubility of molecules using the Delaney dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model building with Linear Regression and Random Forest, performance evaluation using MSE and RÂ², and model comparison. A great beginner-friendly intro to regression in scikit-learn.
âœ… Key Features:

    ðŸ“¥ Loaded the dataset directly from GitHub.

    ðŸ§¹ Preprocessed the data by separating features (X) and target (y), and split it into training and test sets.

    ðŸ¤– Built and trained two models:

        Linear Regression

        Random Forest Regressor

    ðŸ“Š Evaluated model performance using:

        Mean Squared Error (MSE)

        RÂ² Score

    ðŸ“ˆ Compared both models and visualized prediction results to understand model accuracy.

This beginner-friendly project demonstrates how to implement supervised regression models on a real-world dataset using scikit-learn and pandas.
